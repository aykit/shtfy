      shtfy [pron. shitify] is a URL-shortifier run by <a href="http://aykit.org/sites/siteindex_en">aykit</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      We at aykit hate data retention and love open-source. shtfy is keeping data storage to a minimum:
      <dl>
        <dt>
          All URLs shortified
        </dt>
        <dd>
          For shtfy to work correctly, we need to save every URL and it's shortified version.
        </dd>
        <dt>
          Hits
        </dt>
        <dd>
          We save how often a shortified URL has been visited. Note that we only save the amount of hits.
        </dd>
      </dl>
      <p>
        And that is all. If you want to host your own version of shtfy, go to
